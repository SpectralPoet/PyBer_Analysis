# PyBer_Analysis
Mock ride-sharing data analysis


Use your repository README file to write your analysis of how to address any disparities in the ride-sharing data among the city types.

The analysis should contain the following:

  Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of the new analysis.
  
  The purpose of the analysis is exploratory- a summary of relevant company data for the quarter.
  
  Results: Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.

  This overall summary figure, which I plucked out of the data to work here despite not being recommended to save, I think does an excellent job of describing the differences between key statistics in a more comprehensive way than text could do in such a short space. The sixth metric I suspect is the fare per month for each city type, which can be seen below.

  Summary: Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types

There does exist a significant disparity between city types in all forms of data. However, it is worth nothing that while rural cities make up 5.3% of all rides (Fig. 3), they only have 2.6% of all drivers (Fig 4.). This likely contributes in some part to the disparity in price of rides being given (Fig. 2) I would recommend to the CEO that they focus an advertising campaign on recruiting drivers for rural areas. Looking at the same secquence of figures, we can see that the same disparity exists for suburban areas, although to a lesser extent. Thus, I would also recommend to the CEO an advertising campaign to recruit more drivers in suburban areas. Finally, since the same figures indicate to us that urban areas have more drivers with less rides, I would recommend advertising in urban areas to target potential riders, to increase rides to the supply of drivers. If our CEO wants to know who to target these advertisements to, well, perhaps we could do some useful data analysis ;)
